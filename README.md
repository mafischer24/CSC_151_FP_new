## Introduction

Welcome to our Map Visualizer! Our web app is designed to introduce
users to `leaflet` and `shiny` in R. Our target audience is Smith
College students; however, because the code for our app is available on
GitHub, the scope of our audience may be a lot wider. Maps are fun,
interactive visualizations that simplify complex concepts, provide
context in a geographic setting, visualize where places are, and give
instructions for navigation [1]. We hope to educate and empower the user
by providing them to explore some of the features that leaflet has to
offer. There are two maps with two different sets of features for the
user to explore. The data-set we used is `quakes`. Below is a preview of
the first ten rows of the data-set.

    ##       lat   long depth mag stations
    ## 1  -20.42 181.62   562 4.8       41
    ## 2  -20.62 181.03   650 4.2       15
    ## 3  -26.00 184.10    42 5.4       43
    ## 4  -17.97 181.66   626 4.1       19
    ## 5  -20.42 181.96   649 4.0       11
    ## 6  -19.68 184.31   195 4.0       12
    ## 7  -11.70 166.10    82 4.8       43
    ## 8  -28.11 181.93   194 4.4       15
    ## 9  -28.74 181.74   211 4.7       35
    ## 10 -17.47 179.59   622 4.3       19

Both maps have the following features:

-   5 base maps.
-   A mini window of the world map, with a ‘minimize’ button.

Here is a table of the features unique to each map:

| Mapper                                                            | Mapper 2                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1\. Sliding bar to filter magnitude.                              | 1\. The data points are “clustered” by proximity.                      |
| 2\. Drop-down menu to select a color palette for the data-points. | 2\. Custom markers for each data point based on a range of magnitudes. |
| 3\. A legend for the colors and a Show/Hide button.               |                                                                        |

## Instructions

Our web app has been posted to the R Shiny server, so for the user’s
(your) convenience, all you have to do is click on [this link to open
it.](https://vhcji4-phaidra-martin.shinyapps.io/mapper/)

### Libraries

We used `leaflet` to generate the maps, get the `quake` data, and
implement some fun features. We used `jsfile` to create the export
buttons.

### Packages

We used `RColorBrewer` to get the various color palettes. We used
`shinythemes` to adjust the overall appearance of the web app. We used
`htmlwidgets` to create the buttons for exporting. We used `testthat` to
test if our app connects to the R Shiny server.

## Future Addtions

If we had time to work on our R Shiny web app, we would include or
improve the following things:

1.  Allow the user to import a data-set of their choosing and explore
    the data through all of Shiny’s wonderful features.
    -   Example of this
        [here.](https://matepocs.shinyapps.io/data_analyser/)
2.  Use CSS resize function to adjust the dimensions of the maps,
    particularly Mapper 2.
3.  Add a side-panel or legend for Mapper 2 that indicates the range of
    magnitudes for each custom icon. Or, alternatively, adjust the size
    of the icons based on the range of magnitudes.
    -   See `earthquakeIcons` in `app_export.R` for magnitude ranges.
4.  A way for users to choose their own custom icons.
